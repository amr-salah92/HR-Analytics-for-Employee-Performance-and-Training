### Assumptions and Caveats

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

1. **Data Completeness:** Missing values in key fields such as termination reason and satisfaction scores were either imputed using median values or excluded from analysis.
2. **Tenure Calculations:** Employees with missing hire dates had their tenure estimated based on department averages.
3. **Geographical Data Accuracy:** Employees with missing location data were assigned based on their department's predominant location.
4. **Training Impact Assessment:** The impact of training on performance was assumed based on post-training performance ratings rather than direct causal inference.
